## App kickoff
I'm a product manager with no coding experience. Act as a senior tech lead that will engineer and code the project we are working on

in this project, I want to built a todo app, attached is document includes the product scope and the tech stack suggested. @Project Scope 

As I have no coding experience, it is required that you will do the tech planning, coding, write, run and automate tests, and review your own code. also it is required that you produce the least amount of bugs possile. that is why I suggest this stack after research, e.g. I picked Tamagui as it is a very solid, unified ui library that works for app and web out of the box, also it has its own animation library,


Review the project scope and suggest any changes in the tech stack to maximize the needs above.  DONT implement any code till I approve the final tech stack


## review suggested tech stack
for all the suggested added systems to the tech stack, please review again and give me a structured assessment how each will complicate your work by making the code base more complex, thus more potential mistakes by you

## assess tamagui
what about tamagui for ui and animation, shall we keep it or replace it with a simpler framework? which decision will result in less bugs and debugging? note that other frameworks like react-native-paper doesn't have animation built in

## assess zustand
review the projeect scope document @Project Scope again and assess again the following

shall we keep (Zustand and react queary) or remove it all together for simplicity? which decision will result in less bugs and debugging? 

## Last review for tech stack
then based on ourr discussion below is the tech stack we agreed on, please review one last time, remember our main objective is I have no coding experience, it is required that you will do the tech planning, coding, write, run and automate tests, and review your own code. also it is required that you produce the least amount of bugs possible

is this the perfect stack for such scope @Project Scope 

* Expo
* Frontend: React Native, React Native for Web, TypeScript
* UI and animation Library: Tamagui 
* Backend/Database: Supabase  
* testing: Maestro and jest
* State Management: Zustand
* React Query 
* Form & Validation:
  * React Hook Form
* Github
* Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and APNs for iOS  
* Production Monitoring: Firebase Crashlytics + Performance (after launch)
* AI Integration: OpenAI API (or similar) for task allocation  
* Payment Integration: RevenueCat (for subscription management)

## I approve, set techstack rules
ok, I approve
I updated the @Project Scope with the agreed on stack above 

As I have no coding experience, it is required that you will do the tech planning, coding, write, run and automate tests, and review your own code.

now based on this tech stack we agreed on, search the internet for each and every of the technologies in the tech stack for official documentations, and best practices,

Then in the @TechStack rules , add rules for your self that makes you produce the absolutly least amount of bugs, write high quality code, create, run your own maestro tests, with the simplest possible code base. 

- keep the rules you add perfectly inline with the @Implementation rules 
- be as restricted and simple in the practices as possible, so that we don't growing complexities in the code base
- these rules must be followed strictly by you.

# phases------------------

- don't provide edit requests till I approve your plans
- remember @Docs/project rules.md

## phase plan
now lets proceed with @Docs/setup plan.md . for phase 1.2 (TypeScript Configuration) give me a detailed step by step plan

define the steps in the light of @Docs/project rules.md
for each step explain in easy english and I have limited coding experience
make sure you don't prematurely add changes that will be covered in the future in @Docs/setup plan.md
follow the rules in @Docs/TechStack rules.md
no edit requests now till I approve your plan

## phase plan review 
Review, are these changes inline with @Docs/project rules.md  @Docs/TechStack rules.md? analysis in the light of the balance between simplicity, bugs prevention, and scalability. note that this is the potential project scale scope @Docs/project scope.md 
no edit requests now till I approve your plan

## phase implementation 
I approve, i added your plan in a doc @Docs/setup plans/typescript-config.md 
let's implement this plan 

- this implementation is to serve the project @Docs/project scope.md and tech stack setup plsn @Docs/setup plan.md
- follow the rules in @Docs/TechStack rules.md
- stricktly follow the @Docs/project rules.md
- {provide edit requests}
- add comment above each edit explaining what this change it about
  
# Code review
I want you to review your own code in phase 1.1 from the @Docs/setup plan.md and detailed in @Docs/setup plans/expo-setup.md , following the @Docs/Code Review rules.md  and @Docs/project rules.md

review against our @Docs/TechStack rules.md, @Docs/project rules.md
analysis in the light of the balance between simplicity, bugs prevention, and scalability. note that this is the potential project scale scope @Docs/project scope.md
dont mention issues that will be covered in future phases in the setup plan @Docs/setup plan.md unless its required to be done in this phase
Don't provide edit requests for any changes now till I approve



# plan for fixes

ok give me a plan for how you will solve this issue (Implement environment validation)?

give me a detailed plan followiing our @Implementation rules and @Stack rules 
don't implement till I approve the plan
