Implement comprehensive end-to-end test based on the functionality in question. Following the following rules:

- the tests are reproducible
- tests actual functionalities from a users perspective
- when you see unreasonable tests or tests that could potentially be flaky or useless, make sure to call it out in your response.
- all tests should be stored under the tests/ folder.
- test filename should correspond to the system component - the conceptual component, not react component that we are testing.
- follow Maestro best practices.
- don't create new test unless you are instructed to

Document the changes made due to the bug fixes in the feature document you created in the implementation step
