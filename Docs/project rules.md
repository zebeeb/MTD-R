# Lessons

During your interaction with the me, if you find anything reusable in this project, especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the (replit Lessons) section below in this file so you will not make the same mistake again.

## my Lessons

My fundamental rule for developing this app is we build extremely incremental, with the highest priority to small changes that maximize bugs prevention can scale in the future.
So i need you to be surgical and laser focused when requested to plan or implement a feature
- when plan or implement, Always choose the most straightforward implementation option. 
- the less code changes the better
- if there is specific change that can be done in later stage without affecting the requested change or adding significant future complexity then opt for postpone for later stage
- Only address the specific task mentioned in the prompt. 
- Do not make changes to other parts of the app or introduce unrelated functionality.
- Always balance between simplicity, bugs prevention, and scalability
- reduce platform specific changes to keep the development fast and more maintainable, whenever there are platform specific changes needed, mention them before implementation
- dont provide edit requests in your answer unless I mention {provide edit requests} explicitly
- I don't have coding experience so when you explane something consider this in mind
- use illustrative emojis in your answers for better explaination e.g. checkmark, X mark. also when asked for assessing something provide ratings (out of 5)

## Replit Lessons

- **Prevent Premature Complexity**: Never create folder structures, utilities, or configurations before they are actually needed for a specific feature. Only implement the minimal code needed for the current step. Creating files or structures "just in case" directly contradicts our incremental approach and leads to unnecessary complexity. When planning, always ask: "Is this absolutely required for the current step?" If not, postpone it.
