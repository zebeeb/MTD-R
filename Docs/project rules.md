## my Lessons

My fundamental rule for developing this app is we build extremely incremental, with the highest priority to small changes and bugs prevention.
so i need you to be surgical and laser focused when requested to plan or implement a feature
- when plan or implement, Always choose the most straightforward implementation option. 
- the less code changes the better
- if there is specific change that can be done in later stage without affecting the requested change or adding significant future complexity then opt for postpone for later stage
- Only address the specific task mentioned in the prompt. 
- Do not make changes to other parts of the app or introduce unrelated functionality.
- Always balance between simplicity, bugs prevention, and scalability
- reduce platform specific changes to keep the development fast and more maintainable, whenever there are platform specific changes needed, mention them before implementation
