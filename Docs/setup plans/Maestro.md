📱 Maestro Test Setup Plan (Phase 3.1)

Based on the project documentation and codebase, here's a detailed step-by-step plan for setting up Maestro testing for your Todo app. This plan follows the incremental approach specified in your project rules.

Step 1: Understand Maestro Testing Framework 🧠

**What it is**: Maestro is an end-to-end testing framework specifically designed for mobile apps that lets you write tests that simulate real user interactions.

**Simple explanation**: Maestro is like having a robot that can use your app exactly like a real person would - tapping buttons, typing text, and checking if things appear on screen.

Step 2: Setup Maestro Configuration ⚙️

**What we'll do**: Create the minimal configuration needed to run Maestro tests in your project.

**Simple explanation**: We'll create a special folder and files that tell Maestro how to run tests for your app.

Step 3: Create Basic Test Structure 📁

**What we'll do**: Set up a basic test folder structure following Maestro best practices.

**Simple explanation**: We'll organize test files in a way that makes them easy to find and run, focusing only on what we need right now.

Step 4: Write First Basic Test 📝

**What we'll do**: Create a simple test that verifies the app launches correctly and basic navigation works.

**Simple explanation**: We'll write a test that checks if your app opens and if you can navigate between the main screens (Today, Tomorrow, All tasks).

Step 5: Configure Test Running in Replit 🏃‍♂️

**What we'll do**: Set up Replit to be able to run Maestro tests easily.

**Simple explanation**: We'll make it simple to run tests with a single command in Replit.

Step 6: Create Test Documentation 📄

**What we'll do**: Add basic documentation about how tests work and how to run them.

**Simple explanation**: We'll write simple instructions so you understand how testing works in your project.
