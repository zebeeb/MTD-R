📱 Simplified Expo Setup Plan (Phase 1.1)

Here's a focused, incremental plan for setting up the Expo environment, following our project rules:

Step 1: Initialize Minimal Expo Project ✅

We'll start with the basics already in place in the Replit environment, which has already created an Expo project with:

- Basic project structure
- Essential configuration files
- Necessary dependencies

The current setup already includes:

- Expo SDK
- React Navigation
- TypeScript configuration
- Basic app structure

Step 2: Verify Project Configuration 🧪

We'll verify that the current configuration works properly by:

- Checking the app.json file for correct settings
- Ensuring the expo router is properly configured
- Confirming TypeScript is set up correctly

Step 3: Create Minimal Source Structure 📁

We'll implement only the absolutely necessary structure for our first feature:

- Create only essential directories as needed
- Keep it simple with minimal folders
- Only add what we need for immediate development

Step 4: Setup Replit Dev Environment 🛠️

We'll ensure the Replit environment is properly configured for Expo development:

- Verify the .replit file has the correct workflows
- Confirm the correct ports are exposed
- Ensure the Run button is properly configured

Step 5: Test Base Configuration 🧪

Finally, we'll test the minimal configuration to ensure it works properly:

- Run the Expo development server
- Verify the app loads properly on web
- Confirm the QR code works for mobile testing

This plan follows our incremental approach by:

- Only creating what we need right now
- Starting with the minimal viable structure
- Avoiding premature complexity
- Building only what's necessary for our immediate needs
