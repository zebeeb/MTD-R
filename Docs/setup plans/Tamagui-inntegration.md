📱 Tamagui Integration Plan (Phase 1.3)

Based on the project rules and tech stack requirements, here's a focused step-by-step plan for integrating Tamagui into your Expo project. I've designed this plan to be incremental, focusing only on what's needed right now without introducing premature complexity.

Step 1: Install Tamagui Core Dependencies ⚙️

We'll start by installing only the essential Tamagui packages needed for basic functionality:

- **What this does**: Adds the minimum Tamagui libraries to your project
- **Why it matters**: Creates the foundation for your UI components without overwhelming complexity
- **Simple explanation**: Think of this like buying the basic ingredients before cooking - we're just getting what we need to start

Step 2: Configure Tamagui for Expo ⚙️

We'll set up the basic configuration file for Tamagui:

- **What this does**: Creates a configuration file that tells Tamagui how to work with your app
- **Why it matters**: Without proper configuration, Tamagui won't work correctly with Expo
- **Simple explanation**: This is like setting up the rules of the game before playing - we need to tell Tamagui how to behave in our app

Step 3: Update App Root Component 🔄

We'll modify your main app component to use Tamagui:

- **What this does**: Wraps your app with Tamagui's provider component
- **Why it matters**: Makes Tamagui available throughout your entire application
- **Simple explanation**: This is like plugging in the power - it activates Tamagui for all parts of your app

Step 4: Create a Test Component ✅

We'll create a simple test component to verify Tamagui is working:

- **What this does**: Creates a basic button or text component using Tamagui
- **Why it matters**: Confirms that Tamagui is properly integrated
- **Simple explanation**: This is like testing a light switch after installation - we need to make sure it works before moving forward

Step 5: Verify Installation 🧪

We'll run the app to verify that Tamagui is working correctly:

- **What this does**: Tests that everything is functioning as expected
- Include a verification step to check for dependency conflicts
- **Why it matters**: Ensures we haven't broken anything and that Tamagui is ready to use
- **Simple explanation**: This is like a quick test drive after adding a new part to your car

What This Plan Avoids:

- ❌ No complex component library creation (that comes later)
- ❌ No animation setup yet (will be addressed when needed)
- ❌ No advanced theming (keeping it minimal for now)
- ❌ No unnecessary configuration options

This plan follows our incremental approach by:

- ✅ Focusing only on what we need right now
- ✅ Keeping changes minimal and focused
- ✅ Building a solid foundation we can expand on later
- ✅ Avoiding "just in case" complexity

Once you approve this plan, I'll implement it step by step with detailed explanations.
