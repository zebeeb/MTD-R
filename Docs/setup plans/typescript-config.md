📝 TypeScript Configuration Plan (Phase 1.2)

I've reviewed the project rules and TypeScript configuration requirements, and here's a focused step-by-step plan that follows our incremental approach.

Step 1: Review Current TypeScript Configuration ✅

First, we'll check the existing TypeScript configuration to understand what's already set up:

- The  file exists and has the basic configuration

    tsconfig.json

- The current setup includes strict type checking
- The configuration extends from the Expo base TypeScript configuration

This step is just verification - no changes needed yet!

Step 2: Verify TypeScript Linting Rules 🔍

We'll check if TypeScript linting rules are properly set up:

- Check for any existing linting configuration
- Ensure TypeScript errors are properly highlighted in the editor
- Validate that the strict mode settings are correctly enforced

Again, this is verification only - we're not making changes yet.

Step 3: Create Base Types for Our App 📊

We need to create essential types that will be used throughout the app:

- Create minimal type definitions only for what we need right now
- Focus only on core structures needed for the immediate next steps
- Avoid creating types "just in case" - only what we actually need now

Step 4: Set Up Path Aliases 🔄

Path aliases make importing components and utilities easier:

- Verify the current path aliases in tsconfig.json
- Ensure the paths match our project structure
- Make minimal updates if needed to support our immediate development

Step 5: Test TypeScript Integration 🧪

Finally, we'll verify everything is working correctly:

- Create a simple test file with TypeScript
- Ensure the compiler correctly flags type errors
- Validate that imports using path aliases work correctly

This plan follows our incremental approach by:

- Only focusing on what we need right now
- Avoiding premature optimization
- Making minimal changes to the existing configuration
- Setting up only what's necessary for our immediate next steps

Each step is focused on verification and minimal necessary changes rather than creating complex structures prematurely.
