🔍 Overview

Error handling is crucial for user experience and debugging. This plan establishes a minimal but effective error handling system that will:

- Standardize how errors are captured and displayed
- Provide consistent error messages to users
- Make debugging easier for developers

📋 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

Step 1: Create Basic Error Types 📑

We'll define basic error types that your application will need based on your project scope.

**What this means in simple terms:**

- We'll create a file that defines different kinds of errors your app might encounter
- These will help us identify what went wrong when something fails
- Examples include network errors, validation errors, and authentication errors

This step is necessary because it creates a foundation for consistent error handling throughout the app.

Step 2: Implement Error Utility Functions 🛠️

We'll create simple utility functions to standardize how errors are handled across the app.

**What this means in simple terms:**

- We'll create helper functions that make it easier to handle errors consistently
- These functions will help format error messages in a user-friendly way
- They'll also help with logging errors for debugging

This step ensures that errors are handled consistently throughout your application.

Step 3: Create Error Boundary Component 🛡️

We'll implement a basic error boundary component to prevent the entire app from crashing when an error occurs in a component.
- Create a basic placeholder error boundary file with minimal functionality
- Implement actual error boundaries when we start building real UI components
- Enhance error boundaries as we add more complex features


This component is important for maintaining app stability and providing a better user experience.

Step 4: Integrate with React Query Error Handling ⚙️


We'll connect our error handling with the React Query setup you already have to manage API errors consistently.

**What this means in simple terms:**

- When your app tries to get data from the internet and something goes wrong
- Our error handling system will catch those errors
- It will display appropriate messages to users
- It will format the errors in a consistent way for easier debugging

This integration is necessary because data fetching is a common source of errors in apps.

Step 5: Create Basic User-Facing Error Components 👤

1. **Create only ONE minimal error message component** that can:
    - Display a simple error message
    - Optionally show a retry button
    - Handle the most basic error presentation needs
2. **Postpone specialized error components** until specific features require them, such as:
    - Network error displays
    - Form validation error displays
    - Authentication error displays
Step 6: Test Error Handling Implementation 🧪


1. **Create basic test cases** for:
    - Error utility functions
    - Basic error component
    - Error type definitions
2. **Test error handling integration** with React Query to ensure proper error interception
3. **Verify error documentation** is clear and follows project standards
🌟 Benefits of This Approach

This plan follows your project rules by:

1. ✅ Being extremely incremental (only adding what's needed now)
2. ✅ Preventing bugs through standardized error handling
3. ✅ Setting up a scalable foundation for future features
4. ✅ Keeping changes minimal and focused
5. ✅ Avoiding premature complexity

I've carefully studied your tech stack rules and will ensure all code:

- Uses proper TypeScript typing
- Handles errors consistently
- Follows React and React Native best practices
- Stays minimal while being extensible

⏭️ Next Steps

After error handling is set up, we can proceed to the next phase in your setup plan (Supabase Integration in Phase 2.4). Error handling provides a solid foundation that will make implementing future features more reliable.
