📊 Supabase Integration Plan (Phase 2.4)

After carefully reviewing the codebase and project documents, here's a focused, incremental plan for integrating Supabase as mentioned in the setup plan. This plan follows your project rules for incremental development and simplicity.

🔍 Overview

Supabase will be integrated for backend database services, without touching future phases like authentication (which is Phase 2.5). I'll ensure we only implement what's necessary right now.

📋 Step-by-Step Plan

Step 1: Install Supabase Client Library 📦

- We'll install the Supabase JavaScript client library
- This is the minimum requirement to connect to Supabase

Step 2: Create Environment Configuration Variables 🔐


**Technical details:**

- We'll add Supabase URL and API key variables to your environment configuration
- We'll update the .env.example file to show what variables are needed
- We'll leverage your existing environment configuration setup

Step 3: Create a Simple Supabase Client Connection Utility 🔌

**What this means in simple terms:**

- We'll create a minimal supabase.ts utility file in the utils folder
- This will initialize the Supabase client with proper typing
- We'll make it simple and reusable throughout the app

Step 4: Create Basic Database Types 📝

- We'll create TypeScript types that match your database tables
- We'll keep these minimal and only include what's needed now
- This will help with type safety when using Supabase queries

Step 5: Connect Supabase with React Query 🔄

- We'll create minimal helper functions to use Supabase with React Query
- This will leverage your existing queryClient setup
- We'll focus only on the read operations needed for now

Step 6: Create a Simple Test Component 🧪

- We'll create a minimal test component or function
- This will verify that we can connect to Supabase
- It won't be part of your final app - just for testing

💡 Benefits of This Approach

This plan follows your project rules by:

1. ✅ Building extremely incrementally (only adding what's needed now)
2. ✅ Focusing on small changes that prevent bugs
3. ✅ Setting up a foundation that can scale in the future
4. ✅ Following the Tech Stack rules for proper typing and error handling
5. ✅ Avoiding premature implementation of future phases (like authentication)

📝 Notes

- This plan only handles database connectivity, not authentication (which is Phase 2.5)
- We're keeping changes minimal and focused
- We're building on your existing setup for environment variables and React Query
- No folder structures or utilities will be created unless absolutely necessary
