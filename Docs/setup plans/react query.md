üìä React Query Setup Plan (Phase 2.2)

After reviewing your codebase and project documentation, I've created a detailed step-by-step plan for implementing React Query according to your incremental approach. This will help us add data fetching capabilities while keeping complexity to a minimum.

üîç Understanding React Query

React Query is a library that helps manage remote data in your app. It handles:

- Fetching data from APIs
- Caching the results
- Automatically refreshing data when needed
- Managing loading and error states

üìù Implementation Plan

Step 1: Install Required Packages

We'll need to install TanStack Query (formerly known as React Query) packages:




Step 2: Create Minimal Query Configuration

We'll set up the most basic configuration needed to get React Query working in your app.

1. Create a new file for the query client configuration
2. Set up proper TypeScript types for the query client
3. Configure basic settings (retry logic, cache time)
4. Setting appropriate retry options in the QueryClient configuration
5. Including basic error handling in the QueryClientProvider setup
6. Not creating any elaborate error utilities or standardized error systems (which will come in Phase 2.3)

Step 3: Add Query Provider to App

We'll wrap your app with the QueryProvider component so all parts of your app can use React Query.

1. Modify the root layout component
2. Add the QueryProvider wrapper
3. Ensure proper TypeScript typing



üß© Why This Approach?

This plan follows your project rules by:

1. ‚úÖ Being extremely incremental (only adding what's needed now)
2. ‚úÖ Preventing bugs through proper TypeScript typing
3. ‚úÖ Setting up a scalable foundation for future features
4. ‚úÖ Keeping changes minimal and focused
5. ‚úÖ Avoiding premature complexity

I've carefully studied your tech stack rules and will ensure all code:

- Uses proper TypeScript typing
- Handles errors consistently
- Follows React Query's recommended patterns
- Stays minimal while being extensible

‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

After React Query is set up, we can proceed to the next phase in your setup plan (Error Handling in Phase 2.3). React Query provides a solid foundation for data fetching that will work well with the upcoming phases.
