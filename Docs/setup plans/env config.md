📋 Environment Configuration Plan (Phase 1.4)


Step 1: Understand Current Environment Setup ✅

First, I'll examine the existing environment configuration in your project:

- Your project already has expo-constants installed (I can see it in your package.json)
- You don't currently have a dedicated environment configuration system
- The app.json already contains some configuration but not for environment variables

- This is purely investigative without any code changes
- Focuses on understanding what's already available
- Prevents duplicate work or conflicts
- Follows your rule of "the less code changes the better"

Step 2: Create Basic Environment Types 📝

We'll define TypeScript types for our environment variables:

- Create a simple type definition file for environment variables
- Only include the minimal types needed for current features
- Keep it simple and expandable for future needs
- Avoids premature type definitions


Step 3: Set Up Environment Configuration Files 🔧

We'll create the minimal required environment files:

- Create a basic .env.example file (not an actual .env file yet)
- Add only essential environment variables needed for current features
- Include comments explaining what each variable is for
- Creates only template files, not actual secret files
- Minimal content focused on immediate needs
- Follows "straightforward implementation" principle


Step 4: Create Environment Helper 🛠️

We'll create a simple utility to access environment variables:

- Create a basic configuration file that reads from environment variables
- Set up default values for local development
- Make it easy to access environment values from anywhere in the app


Step 5: Update Expo Configuration 🔄

We'll make minimal changes to Expo configuration:

- Update app.json or app.config.js only if absolutely necessary
- Ensure Expo can properly handle environment variables
- Keep changes focused only on what's needed now


Step 6: Document the Environment Setup 📚

We'll create simple documentation:

- Document how to use the environment configuration
- Include examples for common use cases
- Make it easy for you to understand how to add new variables later 

Step 7: Test Environment Configuration ✅

We'll verify everything works:

- Create a simple test to ensure environment variables are accessible
- Verify that the configuration works as expected
- Ensure the system is ready for use in future features
