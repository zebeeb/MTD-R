📦 Zustand Implementation Plan (Phase 2.1)

After carefully reviewing the project documents, here's a detailed step-by-step plan for implementing Zustand in your Todo app, focusing on keeping things simple, preventing bugs, and maintaining scalability.

🔍 Step 1: Install Zustand Package

**What is this step?**

We need to add the Zustand library to our project. This is a simple package that will help manage the app's state.

**Simple explanation:**

Zustand is like a central storage box for all the information in your app. Before we can use it, we need to add it to our project.

🏗️ Step 2: Create Basic Store Structure

**What is this step?**

Create a simple, foundational store structure that follows the TypeScript guidelines in your tech stack rules.

**Simple explanation:**

We'll create a new folder called "store" with a basic file that will hold the core information for your todo app. Think of this as creating a storage cabinet with labeled drawers for your app's data.

✅ Step 3: Define Task Types

**What is this step?**

Create TypeScript definitions for the core data structures like Task and List.

**Simple explanation:**

Before we can store tasks, we need to tell the app what a "task" looks like. This is like creating a template for all tasks, specifying what information each task should have (title, description, due date, etc.).

🗃️ Step 4: Create Task Store

**What is this step?**

Implement the main task store with essential actions for task management.

**Simple explanation:**

Now we'll create the actual storage system for tasks, with ways to add, edit, delete, and organize tasks. This is where the app will keep track of all your to-do items.

🧩 Step 5: Implement Basic Selectors

**What is this step?**

Add simple selectors to retrieve tasks based on common filters.

**Simple explanation:**

We'll add ways to easily find specific tasks, like getting all tasks for today, tomorrow, or from a particular list. This is like adding a search function to your storage cabinet.

🔄 Step 6: Create a Basic Store Provider

**What is this step?**

Create a simple provider component to make the store accessible throughout the app.

**Simple explanation:**

This step creates a connection that makes your task storage available to every part of your app. It's like installing wiring that connects your storage cabinet to every room in the house.

🧪 Step 7: Set Up Basic Test for Store

**What is this step?**

Create a minimal test setup to ensure the store works correctly.

**Simple explanation:**

We'll create a simple test to make sure our storage system works. This is like checking that all the drawers in your new cabinet open and close properly.

🧠 Important Considerations

1. **Following incremental approach:** This plan focuses only on what's needed for the current phase, without implementing complex features that will be added later.
2. **Balance between simplicity and scalability:** The structure is simple enough to understand but organized to allow for future growth.
3. **TypeScript integration:** All stores will have proper TypeScript types to prevent bugs.
4. **No unnecessary complexity:** We're not creating multiple stores or complex structures until they're actually needed.
5. **Focusing on core functionality:** We're implementing only what's needed for basic task management, leaving more advanced features for future phases.

This plan aligns with your project rules by:

- Only implementing what's needed right now
- Keeping changes minimal and focused
- Prioritizing simplicity while preventing bugs
- Setting up a foundation that can scale later
