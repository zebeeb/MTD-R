Incremental Tech Stack Implementation Plan for Todo App

## before building the core features
### Phase 1: Core Setup

1. **Expo Setup**: Configure Expo development environment with proper directory structure for cross-platform development (iOS, Android, Web)
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Set up TypeScript with strict type checking and proper configuration for React Native development
3. **Tamagui Integration**: Implement Tamagui UI framework for consistent styling and animation across platforms
4. **Environment Configuration** : Add a simple .env file structure in the project root, Use Expo's built-in environment variable handling through expo-constants, Create a centralized configuration file that pulls values from environment variables

### Phase 2: State Management & Data Handling

1. **Zustand Implementation**: Set up Zustand for lightweight state management with proper store structure and TypeScript integration
2. **React Query Setup**: Configure React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization with proper typing
3. **Error Handling**: Create a simple error utility file with standardized error handling functions, Define a basic set of error types relevant to your application (API errors, validation errors, etc.), Implement a consistent pattern for try/catch blocks for async operations, Add a simple error boundary component for React components
4. **Supabase Integration**: Connect Supabase for backend services including database
5. Connect Supabase for authentication

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure

1. **Maestro Test Setup**: Configure end-to-end testing framework with Maestro
