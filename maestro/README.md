# Maestro Tests for Todo App

This directory contains end-to-end tests using Maestro for our Todo app.

## What is Maestro?

Maestro is an end-to-end testing framework for mobile apps that allows you to write tests that simulate real user interactions like tapping buttons, typing text, and verifying elements on screen.

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `flows` directory and follow Maestro's YAML format.
